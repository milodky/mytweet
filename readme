final project:

v1:
i can search tweets using the existing apis
next step:
	finish the core algorithm
	note the results may not be precise
git on ubuntu modified, see the effects

v2:
- naive bayes is added, which is from internet
- twitter_request_handler is created, which creates requests to the twitter api
next step:
	assembly the existing component
	figure out how to get user's timeline
v3:
- components assemblied, can classify the tweets received from the api
- Bad performance, trying to improve it, but too hard for me at this point
next step:
	authentication
	get user's timeline
	put it on google app engine

v4:
- can be executed by google app engine locally
next step:
	frontend work, totally have no sense of it
	make use of nltk library to enhance the classification
