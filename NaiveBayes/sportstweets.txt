Something called "a touchdown" just happened in the Falcons-Cowboys game.
You can just copy and paste this for later tonight: Tony Romo has thrown an interception.
It's hard to believe that Carson Palmer threw a terrible interception to lose the game until you remember that it's Carson Palmer.
Good job, good effort Steelers.

Romo wins it for the Giants! That sentence has two meanings today.
Somewhere in Dallas, Tony Romo just threw another interception.
Peyton Manning, still awesome.
Just like we've been saying all day, Tony Romo is the MOST CLUTCH QB IN THE LEAGUE.
Could not have written a more perfect ending than Tony Romo backpedaling 20 yards on 4th down and then throwing an interception.
Only takeaway from the Raiders-Chiefs game: Matt Barkley should start looking into real estate in the Kansas City area.
Trading Places 2: Starring Tony Romo and Eli Manning
Tony Romo just needs to do something real quick before he runs to the locker room... http://t.co/L6yYFUv9
